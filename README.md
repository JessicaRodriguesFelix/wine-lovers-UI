Crush Club is **React TypeScript** application that brings the joy of wine exploration to wine enthusiasts.

The primary goal of the initial MVP was to create a user-friendly interface that enables users to:

- Explore a selection of available wines for purchase.
- Easily add desired wines to their shopping cart.
- Quickly find their favorite wines using a search input feature.
- Wine Details Page: A detailed view for each wine, with winery,location, rating average, and number of reviews.

Happy wine exploration with Wine Lovers Club UI Project! Cheers! üç∑üç∑üç∑
